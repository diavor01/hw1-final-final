**Problem Statement:** 
  Extracting image data from the corrupted files by identifying and separating 
  the legitimate rows to reconstruct the uncorrupted image

**Use Cases:** 
-  Restore a corrupted PGM file by identifying valid image rows and discarding 
injected ones.
-  Validate input files for structural integrity.
-  efficiently read files containing arbitrary-length lines

**Assumptions:**
-  Input:
  -  Injected rows and original rows can be differentiated by their infusion 
  sequence of non-digit bytes.
  - Images are at least a 2x2 grid
  - The input can come from both stdin or from a file
-  Corruption:
  -    The corrupted images originate from "plain" PGM files(P2)
  -    Each original row is terminated by a newline character (\n) that 
  remains unchanged.
  -    Corruption does not alter the row order but adds extra rows
  
**Constraints:**
-  The restoration program should process even large images efficiently in 
under 20 seconds
-  Hansonâ€™s data structures are available and must be used when appropriate
(except for arrays)

**Hanson's data abstractions used and their purposes:**
-  Sequences:
   -  they can store data sequentially
   -  they can resize dynamically
-  Atoms
   -  they allow for atom equality, which is essential for comparing the 
   injected sequences
   
**File Descriptions:**
-  main.c:
    -  checks the type of input received and passes it on to the restoration 
    function
-  readaline.c and its header file:
    -  reads a corrupted line of text at a time. A line can contain any ASCII 
    characters (including NULL) and is guaranteed to end with "\n"
-  functions.c and its header file:
    -  helper file that includes functions to convert the sequence of numbers 
    to binary and write both the contents and header to a p5 format as well as 
    assemble and interpret the matrix of bytes
-  restoration.c and its header file:
    -  the file responsible for the restoration process from a corrupted plain 
    file to a p5 pgm file

**Architecture:**
-  For readaline, we will be using a pointer to char called buffer to store 
the characters. Buffer stops receiving input when finding the endline character.
-  Once the line is constructed, we check the injected sequence of characters 
(stored in atoms). When finding identical atoms, we store the appropriate 
numbers (converted to binary) inside a matrix (which is a sequence of 
sequences containing uint8_t values).
-  Once we have the correct sequence of lines along with the dimensions of the 
file, we print the dimensions along with the matrix. This represents the P5 
file.

**Data structures used:**
-  Seq_T atom_sequence: Represents a sequence of atoms. The first step is 
establishing the correct sequence of characters the original lines have been 
injected with. We add a new atom to the sequence until we find identical atoms.
-  Seq_T newRow: representing a sequence of numbers
-  Seq_T matrix: representing a sequence of newRows

**Implementations:**
-  readaline:
    -  The readaline function reads characters one by one from the input file 
    and stores them in a buffer (the buffer is allocated dynamically so that 
    its size can change). The loop stops if it encounters the endline 
    character or the end of the file. Then *datapp gets updated and the size 
    of the buffer is returned. If the size is 0 (meaning we no characters have 
    been read, and thus we reached the end of the line), the buffer is freed 
    and the function returns 0
-  restoration:
    -   this is the main function for handling of both decrypting and 
    outputing the uncorruted pgm images. In this file we use readaline to 
    process a corrupted file line by line, storing numbers in matrix_nums and 
    characters in atoms, leveraging pointer equality to identify duplicate 
    sequences. Once duplicates are found, we restore the original PGM file by 
    filtering lines with the correct sequence, converting the data, and 
    outputting it in PGM format with the appropriate header and binary content. 
-  WriteToBinary:
    -  the writeToBinary function reads the characters from the sequence of 
    characters and converts them to bytes that can outputted. This method is 
    called multiple times over a conversion as it adds it to the correct 
    matrix of btyes
  
**Tests:**
  
   - The readaline function will be tested using diff for each corrupted file 
   provided. Additional files will be provided to test each expected error. 
   After that, we will try using larger pgm files (width>1000).
     
   - Diff can be used on original p5 formatted files to compare the converted 
   uncorrupted image vs the uncorrupted image that went through no processing. 
   If no results show that means the files are identical

   - We test reading lines from a file or standard input by providing various 
   inputs (standard strings, empty files, long lines, and null arguments) for 
   the purpose of ensuring the readaline function correctly reads lines, 
   handles edge cases, and reports errors appropriately.

  -  We test atom handling by providing sequences of atoms and lines with 
  mixed numbers and characters for the purpose of ensuring the program 
  correctly identifies existing atoms, extracts injected sequences, and 
  handles non-existing atoms.

  -  We test number and character separation by providing lines with mixed 
  numbers, only numbers, only characters, and empty lines for the purpose of 
  ensuring the program correctly separates numbers and characters and stores 
  them in appropriate data structures.

  - We test matrix construction by providing lines with mixed numbers and 
  characters, as well as invalid data (e.g., negative numbers, numbers 
  exceeding the max grayscale value) for the purpose of ensuring the program 
  correctly constructs rows of numbers and handles edge cases gracefully.

  - We test file restoration by providing corrupted PGM files, large files, 
  and edge cases (empty files, files with only headers, and files with invalid 
  data) for the purpose of ensuring the program correctly restores the files, 
  handles large inputs efficiently, and produces appropriate error messages or 
  output.

  - We test file restoration accuracy by comparing restored files with 
  original uncorrupted files using diff for the purpose of ensuring the 
  restored files are identical to the originals and the program works as 
  expected.

Hours spent: 40 hours

Notes: We are aware of the memory leaks. However, every time we tried to 
delete the value of a sequence out of scope, we encountered a segmentation 
fault.
